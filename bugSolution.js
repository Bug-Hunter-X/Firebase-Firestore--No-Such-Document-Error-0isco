Before jumping to solutions, examine the error message carefully. It sometimes indicates the specific problem.  For instance, it might suggest an incorrect path. 

**Debugging Steps:**
1. **Verify the Collection and Document ID:** Double-check that the collection name and document ID in `doc(db, "collection", "documentId")` are accurate. A simple typo can cause this error.  Use the Firestore console to confirm the collection and document exist.
2. **Check Firestore Security Rules:** Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read access for the user or service account you're using.  Strict rules can prevent data retrieval even if the path is correct. Review your rules, and temporarily loosen them for testing purposes (remember to revert after testing).
3. **Inspect the Firestore Instance:** Make sure `getFirestore()` is initialized correctly and that your project is connected to the correct Firestore instance. Errors here are surprisingly common.
4. **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Wrap your Firestore calls in `try...catch` blocks to handle exceptions properly. This prevents your app from crashing and provides debugging information. The provided example code includes an example of such handling.
5. **Network Connectivity:** Confirm that your app has a stable internet connection and can communicate with Firestore. Network problems can lead to this error.
6. **Asynchronous Operations:** Remember that Firestore operations are asynchronous.  Ensure that you're handling the asynchronous nature of `getDoc` with `await` (as shown in the example) or `.then()` and `.catch()`.
7. **Use the Firestore Console:**  The Firebase console is a great tool for visually inspecting data and troubleshooting Firestore issues.
